Activity 9 - Bootstrapping
================

## Task 2: Load the necessary packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

## Task 3: Create the data

``` r
# Create a data frame/tibble named sim_dat
sim_dat <- tibble(
  # Generate 20 random numbers from a uniform distribution between -5 and 5 and store them in x1
  x1 = runif(20, -5, 5),
  # Generate 20 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100 and store them in x2
  x2 = runif(20, 0, 100),
  # Generate 20 binary outcomes with a probability of success of 0.5 and store them in x3
  x3 = rbinom(20, 1, 0.5)
)

# Define the values of the regression coefficients and the standard deviation of the errors
b0 <- 2
b1 <- 0.25
b2 <- -0.5
b3 <- 1
sigma <- 1.5

# Generate 20 random errors from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation sigma
errors <- rnorm(20, 0, sigma)

# Add a new variable y to sim_dat that is generated by applying the regression equation with errors to the predictor variables
# Also, convert the binary variable x3 to a categorical variable with "No" and "Yes" as the categories
sim_dat <- sim_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + errors,
    x3 = case_when(
      x3 == 0 ~ "No",
      TRUE ~ "Yes"
    )
  )
```

2.  Based on the above code the baseline model is "y = 2 + 0.25*x1 +
    (-0.5)*x2 + 1\*x3 + errors"

$$
Y= 2+ 0.25X1 - 0.5X2 + X3 + Errors
$$
